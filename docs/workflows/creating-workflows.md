# Creating Workflows

Workflows are the core concept of Workflow Manager. Each workflow is a sequence of steps that automate farm operations.

## Workflow Structure

A workflow consists of:

- **Name**: A descriptive identifier (e.g., "Harvest Wheat Fields 1-3")
- **Steps**: Ordered list of AutoDrive routes and Courseplay courses
- **Support sub-steps** (optional): Helper actions nested inside main steps for multi-vehicle setups

## Creating a New Workflow

### From the Workflow Manager

1. Press **Left Alt + W** to open the Workflow Manager
2. Click **New**
3. Enter a workflow name
4. The workflow editor opens

### Naming Best Practices

Use descriptive names that help you identify the workflow:
- Include the crop type: "Harvest Wheat - North Fields"
- Include field numbers: "Fertilize Fields 1, 2, 3"
- Include the operation: "Baling - Grass Meadow"
- For multi-vehicle workflows, note that it requires a support vehicle: "Wheat Harvest (2-vehicle)"

## Adding Steps

Steps are added in the workflow editor.

### Step Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| **AutoDrive** | Navigation between locations, unloading, loading |
| **Courseplay** | Field work (harvesting, seeding, cultivating, baling) |
| **Park / Refuel / Repair** | AutoDrive utility stops with no target to configure — AD resolves the destination itself. See [Step Types](step-types#autodrive-utility-steps) |
| **Wait for Leader / Unlock Follower** | Sync checkpoints for coordinating two vehicles via the [queue system](queue-system) |

### Adding an AutoDrive Step

1. Click **Add Step**
2. Select **AutoDrive** as the type
3. Choose a **Target** destination from the dropdown
4. Select an **Action**:
   - **Drive To** — Simple navigation to target
   - **Unload Combine** — Unload mode (for combines)
   - **Pickup and Deliver** — Load at target, deliver to second location
   - **Deliver** — Deliver current load to target
   - **Load** — Load at target, return to second location
5. For modes requiring two destinations, select **Unload Target**
6. Optionally set **Fill Type** to filter cargo
7. Click **OK**

### Adding a Courseplay Step

1. Click **Add Step**
2. Select **Courseplay** as the type
3. Choose a **Course** from the dropdown
4. Select an **Action**:
   - **Field Work** — Standard field operations
   - **Bale Collect** — Collect and wrap bales
5. Click **OK**

## Adding Support Sub-Steps

Support sub-steps let a second vehicle (e.g., a grain cart) work alongside the main vehicle automatically. Each main step can have its own support sub-steps.

### When to Add Support Sub-Steps

- Add them to **field work steps** where the support vehicle needs to act (e.g., unload the combine and deliver to silo)
- Leave **drive-to steps** without support sub-steps — the support vehicle will idle during transit

### How to Add a Support Sub-Step

1. In the editor, select a **main step** (numbered `1`, `2`, `3`, …)
2. Click **Add Support Step** at the bottom of the editor
3. Configure the sub-step in the Step Dialog (same fields as a regular step)
4. Click **OK**

The sub-step appears indented below the main step, numbered `N.M` (e.g., `2.1`, `2.2`).

Repeat to add multiple sub-steps. They execute in order while the main vehicle stays on that step.

```
  #     Type        Target              Action
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1     AutoDrive   Field1_Entrance     Drive To
  2     Courseplay  Field1_Harvest      Field Work   +2
  2.1     AutoDrive   Field1            Unload Combine
  2.2     AutoDrive   Silo              Deliver
  3     AutoDrive   Field2_Entrance     Drive To
  4     Courseplay  Field2_Harvest      Field Work   +2
  4.1     AutoDrive   Field2            Unload Combine
  4.2     AutoDrive   Silo              Deliver
```

See [Multi-Vehicle Workflows](linked-workflows) for full details on how the support vehicle behaves at runtime.

## Editing Steps

### Reordering Steps

- Select a step and use **Move Up** / **Move Down** buttons
- Or use keyboard shortcuts: **U** to move up, **D** to move down
- Support sub-steps are reordered within their parent step only

### Modifying a Step

1. Double-click the step or select and click **Edit**
2. Modify the step properties
3. Click **OK** to save

### Deleting Steps

1. Select the step
2. Click **Delete** or press **R**

Deleting a main step also removes all of its support sub-steps.

## Workflow Example

Here's a complete workflow for harvesting multiple fields:

```
Workflow: "Wheat Harvest - Fields 1 & 2"

Step 1: AutoDrive → Field1_Entrance          Drive To
Step 2: Courseplay → Field1_Wheat_Harvest     Field Work
Step 3: AutoDrive → Farm/Silo → Sell/Mill     Pickup and Deliver · Filter: Wheat
Step 4: AutoDrive → Field2_Entrance          Drive To
Step 5: Courseplay → Field2_Wheat_Harvest     Field Work
Step 6: AutoDrive → Farm/Silo                Drive To
```

### Two-Vehicle Example (Combine + Unloader)

The same harvest workflow extended with support sub-steps for an unloader:

```
Workflow: "Wheat Harvest - Fields 1 & 2 (2-vehicle)"

Step 1: AutoDrive → Field1_Entrance          Drive To
  (no support sub-steps — unloader idles during transit)

Step 2: Courseplay → Field1_Wheat_Harvest     Field Work
  2.1: AutoDrive → Field1                    Unload Combine → Silo
  2.2: AutoDrive → Silo                      Deliver

Step 3: AutoDrive → Field2_Entrance          Drive To
  (no support sub-steps)

Step 4: Courseplay → Field2_Wheat_Harvest     Field Work
  4.1: AutoDrive → Field2                    Unload Combine → Silo
  4.2: AutoDrive → Silo                      Deliver
```

## Per-Workflow AutoDrive Settings

Each workflow can store AutoDrive overrides that apply automatically on every start. This is useful when different workflows require different unload thresholds or pipe positions without you having to reconfigure AutoDrive manually each time.

Access the settings from the **main dialog**:
1. Select a workflow
2. Click **AD/CP Settings**
3. Fill in any values you want to override and click **OK**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Unload Fill Level** (%) | Minimum fill % before the unloader is called |
| **Pipe Offset** (m) | Horizontal pipe position override |
| **Pre-Call Level** (%) | Fill % at which AutoDrive pre-calls the unloader |

Leave any field empty to keep AutoDrive's existing value for that setting. Settings are applied every time the workflow starts an AutoDrive step.

## Saving Workflows

Workflows are saved automatically when you:
- Close the editor dialog
- Exit the Workflow Manager
- Save the game

Workflows persist in your savegame folder in `workflowManager.xml`.

## Copying Workflows

Currently, workflows cannot be directly copied. To create a similar workflow:
1. Create a new workflow
2. Add the same steps manually

:::tip Future Feature
Workflow copying/templating is planned for a future update.

## Best Practices

1. **Test individual components first**: Ensure your AutoDrive routes and Courseplay courses work independently
2. **Start simple**: Begin with 2-3 step workflows before creating complex sequences
3. **Use descriptive names**: Makes managing multiple workflows easier
4. **Group by operation**: Create separate workflows for different crop types or operations
5. **Consider vehicle requirements**: Ensure your vehicle supports all steps in the workflow
6. **Leave drive steps without support sub-steps**: Support vehicles idle during transit — no configuration needed
