# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for Workflow Manager.

## Installation Issues

### Workflow Manager won't open

**Symptoms**: Pressing **Left Alt + W** does nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the mod is enabled in the mod selection screen
2. Check that both AutoDrive and Courseplay are also enabled
3. Look at the game log (`log.txt`) for error messages
4. Ensure the ZIP file is not corrupted

### "AutoDrive not found" error

**Symptoms**: Error message when opening Workflow Manager

**Solutions**:
1. Install AutoDrive from GitHub or ModHub
2. Enable AutoDrive in the mod selection
3. Restart the game after enabling

### "Courseplay not found" error

**Symptoms**: Error message when opening Workflow Manager

**Solutions**:
1. Install Courseplay from GitHub or ModHub
2. Enable Courseplay in the mod selection
3. Restart the game after enabling

## Workflow Creation Issues

### No destinations in dropdown

**Symptoms**: AutoDrive target dropdown is empty

**Solutions**:
1. Create at least one marker in AutoDrive first
2. Close and reopen the Workflow Manager GUI
3. Check AutoDrive is properly configured

### No courses in dropdown

**Symptoms**: Courseplay course dropdown is empty

**Solutions**:
1. Save at least one course in Courseplay
2. Courses are map-specific - ensure you're on the correct map
3. Check the courses folder: `modSettings/FS25_Courseplay/Courses/[MapName]/`

### Cannot add steps

**Symptoms**: Add Step button doesn't work

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you have a workflow open in the editor
2. Check the game log for errors
3. Try creating a new workflow

## Execution Issues

### Workflow won't start

**Symptoms**: Clicking Start does nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Enter a compatible vehicle first
2. Check the vehicle supports both AD and CP
3. Ensure no other AD/CP job is running
4. Verify the workflow has at least one step

### Unloader doesn't move when Unload step starts

**Symptoms**: Support vehicle (grain cart / unloader) sits idle after its Unload step begins, instead of driving toward the combine

**Cause**: AutoDrive's **Unload** mode is reactive — the unloader waits in place until the combine signals it needs emptying. If the unloader is already on or near the field when the step starts, AutoDrive skips any driving and immediately puts it into passive wait mode at its current position. This can leave it blocking the combine's path.

**Solution**: Add a **Drive To** sub-step immediately before the **Unload Combine** sub-step in the workflow's support sub-steps for that field work step. This moves the unloader to a marker near the field first, so it is already in position when the combine calls.

See [Multi-Vehicle Workflows](workflows/linked-workflows) for tips on structuring support sub-steps.

### Step doesn't complete

**Symptoms**: Workflow stuck on a step

**Solutions**:
1. Check if AD/CP is actually running (look for their indicators)
2. The step may be waiting for a condition (e.g., unloading)
3. Use the HUD Skip button to move to next step
4. Check that the destination/course exists

### AutoDrive step fails

**Symptoms**: AD step errors or doesn't navigate

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the destination exists in AutoDrive
2. Check there's a valid path to the destination
3. Ensure the vehicle is on/near the AD network
4. Test the route manually in AutoDrive first

### Courseplay step fails

**Symptoms**: CP step errors or doesn't start

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the course is loaded on the vehicle
2. Check required implements are attached
3. Ensure the course is for the correct map/field
4. Test the course manually in Courseplay first

### Vehicle drives in circles

**Symptoms**: Vehicle repeating behavior instead of advancing

**Solutions**:
1. The step may have cyclic operations (harvest + unload)
2. Wait for both AD and CP to fully complete
3. Check for stuck AI or pathfinding issues

### Park or Repair step fails immediately

**Symptoms**: The step errors out as soon as it starts

**Solutions**:
1. **Park**: configure a park position on the vehicle (or its rear-attached implement) in AutoDrive first
2. **Repair**: place an AutoDrive-reachable repair/workshop marker on the map
3. Both resolve their destination fresh every run — a marker deleted since the workflow was created will fail the step again

### Refuel step does nothing

**Symptoms**: Workflow moves straight past a Refuel step without the vehicle driving anywhere

**Cause**: This is expected, not a bug — AutoDrive can't distinguish "the vehicle doesn't need fuel" from "no matching station is reachable," so both cases are treated as an instant success and the workflow continues immediately.

### Follower stuck on "Waiting for leader"

**Symptoms**: A follower vehicle never advances past a **Wait for Leader** step

**Solutions**:
1. Check the leader's workflow actually contains a matching **Unlock Follower** step — without one, the follower waits for the leader's entire workflow to finish
2. Verify the leader vehicle is still running (a stopped or finished leader should free the follower automatically within ~1 second)
3. See [Queue System](workflows/queue-system) for how Wait for Leader / Unlock Follower steps pair up

## HUD Issues

### HUD not appearing

**Symptoms**: No workflow HUD when running

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure a workflow is actually running
2. Enter the vehicle that started the workflow
3. Close any open game menus
4. Check if HUD is hidden behind other UI

### HUD buttons not responding

**Symptoms**: Clicking buttons does nothing

**Solutions**:
1. Check button is not disabled (gray color)
2. Ensure mouse cursor is over the button
3. Game window must have focus
4. Try clicking the center of the button

### HUD overlapping other UI

**Symptoms**: HUD covers important game elements

**Solutions**:
1. **Drag the HUD** to a better position — click and hold the HUD header and drag it anywhere on screen
2. Known overlap with the F1 help menu — close the help menu when using workflows

## Save/Load Issues

### Workflows missing after reload

**Symptoms**: Saved workflows don't appear

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you saved the game after creating workflows
2. Check `workflowManager.xml` exists in savegame folder
3. File might be corrupted - check for backup

### XML load errors

**Symptoms**: Error messages about XML on load

**Solutions**:
1. Check `workflowManager.xml` for syntax errors
2. Delete the file to reset (loses all workflows)
3. Restore from backup if available

---

## Performance Issues

### Game stuttering during workflow

**Symptoms**: FPS drops when workflow runs

**Solutions**:
1. Check if AD or CP is causing the issue (test independently)
2. Complex paths or courses may cause load
3. Report issue with log file if persistent

---

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Collect the game log**: Find `log.txt` in your Farming Simulator 25 root folder (the same folder as the game executable)
2. **Note reproduction steps**: Write down exactly how to trigger the issue
3. **Report on GitHub**: [Issues Page](https://github.com/CSchoch/LS25_WorkflowManager/issues)

Include:
- Mod version
- AutoDrive/Courseplay versions
- Game version
- Steps to reproduce
- Relevant log excerpts
